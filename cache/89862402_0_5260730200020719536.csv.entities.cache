V 0917-3221203            FILIPINO WOMEN EXPECT INTENSIFIED HUNGER       WITH GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS            As the international community celebrates World Food Day poor      Filipinos commemorate today as World Foodless Day.            The militant women's group GABRIELA said that with the financial      crisis hunger especially among women and children will intensify. The      group said that prior to the financial crash based on the report      released by the Asian Development Bank 23 million Filipinos are      already living below the new poverty line in Asia-Pacific of $1.35 a      day (P61.50). The group added that in 2006 poor Filipino families      earning P89 per day spend only P53 per day for food (or P18 per meal).             &quot;It has always been the case that women and children suffer more in      times of worsening economic crisis&quot; said GABRIELA Secreteray General Emmi       de Jesus.            &quot;There is none to blame for the current global financial crisis but      the insatiable greed of financial institutions in imperialist      countries for never-ending superprofit. But its failure will wreak      havoc on the lives of of poor peoples all over the world especially      women and children&quot; said de Jesus.            The women's group said that the claim of the Philippine government      that the local economy can withstand the global financial crisis is      pure propaganda.             &quot;It is impossible for a country like the Philippines whose economy is      extremely dependent on the United States to be impervious to the      financial crash in the United States. No Arroyo program will be able      to help buffer the Filipinos from the dire cosequences of the world      financial crisis&quot; said de Jesus.             &quot;In the face of intensfying hunger women as producers and as mothers      must elevate the fight against poverty and hunger from the daily need      to survive to militant action holding accountable the powers-that- be      who are responsible for poverty and hunger. We women must advance      our participation in the people's struggles against imperialist      control and plunder of the world's food and resources&quot; de Jesus      concluded. ###
